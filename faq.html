            <summary><strong>Why is it called Foundryborne?</strong></summary>
            <p>
                Communities in Daggerheart are all named -borne (Wildborne, Seabornde, Loreborne... etc.). Since this is
                a Community Project, we decided to name it Foundryborne.

            <summary><strong>What about translations?</strong></summary>
            <p>
                Currently, community translations should be added as a module (there are already a few available!). For
                the officially announced translations we want to wait for their release first.

        <details>
            <summary><strong>Which FoundryVTT version will I need for this system?</strong></summary>
            <p>
                We are developing for v13. If you don't want to upgrade yet for any reason, you can use the portable
                version of v13 temporarily until you are ready.

            <summary><strong>What features/automations will there be?</strong></summary>
            <p>
                We strife to automate as much as possible - where it makes sense. It will also be possible to disable
                automations in the system settings. You will also find a lot of settings for supporting homebrew
                content. We aim to include the complete SRD content as well.<br /><br />There will be character
                creation automation, as well as levelling up automation. We have a global fear tracker that can be
                customized, a robust countdown system, and even support for the optional action tracker, where players
                can request the spotlight from the GM and have 3 action tokens each.<br />This list is not complete.

        <details>
            <summary><strong>What about the Void playtest content?</strong></summary>
            <p>
                The Void playtest materials are not part of the SRD and therefore can't be included with the system.
                However, the system makes it easily possible to add custom domains and (sub)classes.

        <details>
            <summary><strong>Will you include the official artwork?</strong></summary>
            <p>
                The official artwork is not part of the SRD and therefore can't be included with the system. However,
                you will be able to provide your own artwork for everything. We aim to include as much (non-official)
                artwork as possible.

            <summary><strong>What about Demiplane integration?</strong></summary>
            <p>
                Demiplane currently has no API to make any integration possible. However, we have reached out to them
                and will be actively talking with the Demiplane to see if any kind of integration would be possible - or
                makes sense. This is most likely a feature for a later release however, or possibly even a separate
                module.

                been answered, please use the ticket system in <code>#contact-us</code>.<br />Please do not DM the dev
                team directly, as we are getting too many messages which are distracting us from our work.
