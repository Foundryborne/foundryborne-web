          <summary><strong>(How) Can I contribute?</strong></summary>
          <p>
            You can find a link to the repository in the menu on this website.
            Please either fork & create a pull request, or apply to join the
            GitHub org. We also recommend to join the Discord server.

            <strong>I'm not a developer — can I still contribute?</strong>
          </summary>
          <p>
            Yes! Whenever we need non-developer support, we’ll ask the community
            for help — including testing. Just keep an eye on
            <code>#general</code> (in the future, there will be a dedicated
            announcements channel).
          </p>

        <details>
          <summary><strong>When will the system be available?</strong></summary>
          <p>Very, very soon.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>
            <strong>Is there a preview? Can I help with testing?</strong>
          </summary>
          <p>
            Not yet. Technically, you can check out the code and install it
            manually - if you know what you are doing. However, we can't provide
            any support or instructions for this currently. Expect things to be
            broken or missing until a release version has been published.

          <summary>
            <strong>Is this legal?</strong>
          </summary>
          <p>
            Yes! Darrington Press changed the CGL to allow Foundry system
            development, including the SRD content.

          <summary>
            <strong>What about translations?</strong>
          </summary>
          <p>
            We want to offer translations for the system as well, but that will
            probably happen after the initial release. For the officially
            announced translations we want to wait for their release first.

            We are developing for v13. If you don't want to upgrade yet for any
            reason, you can use the portable version of v13 temporarily until
            you are ready.

            <strong>What features/automations will there be?</strong>
          </summary>
          <p>
            We strife to automate as much as possible - where it makes sense. It
            will also be possible to disable automations in the system settings.
            You will also find a lot of settings for supporting homebrew
            content. We aim to include the complete SRD content as well.<br /><br />There
            will be character creation automation, as well as levelling up
            automation. We have a global fear tracker that can be customized, a
            robust countdown system, and even support for the optional action
            tracker, where players can request the spotlight from the GM and
            have 3 action tokens each.
