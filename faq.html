              The system is not 100% done yet, but it will be released very soon. Please check the Discord server for an official announcement, at which point the link will be working.

              Yes! Whenever we need non-developer support, we’ll ask the
              community for help — including testing. Just keep an eye on
              <code>#general</code> (in the future, there will be a dedicated
              announcements channel).

              We currently do not need any help with data entry. However, that could change in the future, in which case we would announce it on our Discord server.

              Not yet. Technically, you can check out the code and install it
              manually - if you know what you are doing. However, we can't
              provide any support or instructions for this currently. Expect
              things to be broken or missing until a release version has been
              published.

            <summary>
              <strong>Is this legal?</strong>
            </summary>
            <p>
              Yes! Darrington Press changed the CGL to allow Foundry system
              development, including the SRD content.

              <strong>What about translations?</strong>
            </summary>
            <p>
              We want to offer translations for the system as well, but that
              will probably happen after the initial release. For the officially
              announced translations we want to wait for their release first.

            <p>
              We are developing for v13. If you don't want to upgrade yet for
              any reason, you can use the portable version of v13 temporarily
              until you are ready.

          <details id="features-automation">
            <summary>
              <strong>What features/automations will there be?</strong>
            </summary>
            <p>
              We strife to automate as much as possible - where it makes sense.
              It will also be possible to disable automations in the system
              settings. You will also find a lot of settings for supporting
              homebrew content. We aim to include the complete SRD content as
              well.<br /><br />There will be character creation automation, as
              well as levelling up automation. We have a global fear tracker
              that can be customized, a robust countdown system, and even
              support for the optional action tracker, where players can request
              the spotlight from the GM and have 3 action tokens each.<br />This list is not complete.

            <summary id="srd-content">
              <strong>What about SRD content?</strong>
            </summary>
            <p>
              With the new CGL upate we are allowed to include all SRD content, which should be ready for the first official release.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details id="void-playtest">
            <summary>
              <strong>What about the Void playtest content?</strong>
            </summary>
            <p>
              The Void playtest materials are not part of the SRD and therefore can't be included with the system. However, the system makes it easily possible to add custom domains and (sub)classes.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details id="artwork">
            <summary>
              <strong>Will you include the official artwork?</strong>
            </summary>
            <p>
              The official artwork is not part of the SRD and therefore can't be included with the system. However, you will be able to provide your own artwork for everything. We aim to include as much (non-official) artwork as possible.

          <details id="setup-github">
            <summary>
              <strong>How can I install the system from the GitHub repository?</strong>
            </summary>
            <p>We currently do not offer any support to do a manual installation of the system from the code in the repository. Please wait until an official version has been released, then you can just install it like any other system from within Foundry directly.
            </p>

          <details id="demiplane">
            <summary>
              <strong>What about Demiplane intergration?</strong>
            </summary>
            <p>
              Demiplane currently has no API to make any integration possible. However, we have reached out to them and will be actively talking with the Demiplane to see if any kind of integration would be possible. This is most likely a feature for a later release however, or possibly even a separate module.
