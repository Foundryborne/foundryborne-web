                <li>
                    <strong>Adversary Token Sizes</strong>: Added TokenSize for Adversaries. These are size categories
                    you can easily apply to adversaries to set them to predefined, uniform sizes (Tiny, Small, Medium,
                    Large etc). You can edit the token sizes attached to them in the Homebrew Settings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Adversary Features</strong>: Features for Adversaries/Environments now have an ActionForm
                    (Passive|Action|Reaction) that is displayed next to their name in the sheet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tooltips</strong>: Large visual improvements on tooltips.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sheet Improvements</strong>: Improved namefields in the sheets to wrap for longer names.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Chat Messages</strong>: Saving Throw entries in chat messages now display the token name
                    rather than the actor name.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Currency Transfer</strong>: You can now drag and drop currency from one character/party to
                    another to transfer the same way you do for quantities of items.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Bugfixes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where players rolling reaction rolls from chat messages wouldn't register
                    correctly.
                </li>
                <li>

                    active.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where using an experience and simultaneously receiving automated hope on rolling
                    didn't work correctly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue during levelup where you couldn't select an increase on an experience you gained

                    the levelup process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where subclass features a character didn't have access to would show up as about
                    to
                    be refreshed when taking Downtime.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where the Extra-Damage effect from the BattlePoints section in the CombatTracker
                    was being applied to
                    Characters added to combat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an error that could cause TagTeamRolls not to be created properly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue with RangeDependant effect automation (such as the Paired item feature) to be
                    based on
                    player targeting something in range.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where drag-selecting in inputs - such as resource inputs - on the character sheet
                    lead to unexpected
                    behavior.
                </li>
                <li>

                    Resolved an issue where the Sheet Experience section would display incorrectly when an experience
                    name was really long.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Compendium Updates</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    All adversaries have had TokenSizes added.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All beastforms have had TokenSizes added.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All adversaries have had the hardcoded instances of their names removed from features and actions,
                    replaced with a dynamic @lookup. This means if you change the name of the adversary, or drag the
                    feature to another adversary, the name in the text will be updated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Removed adversary action descriptions that just copied the feature description. This means there's
                    only one place to edit instead of two when changing it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Wings Of Light</strong>: Corrected to be self-applied.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Conjure Swarm</strong>: Now correctly lowers incoming damage severity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Elundrian Chain Armor</strong>: Name corrected.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As a note - since Features now have an attached ActionForm (Passive, Action, Reaction) but they didn't
                previously - existing adversaries outside of the updated SRD Compendium will have defaulted to show
                Passive.

                </li>
                <li>

                    Resolved an issue where the Downtime dialog would fail to open.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where TagTeamDialog crit damage was not correctly calculated when a multi-dice
                    formula was present (ex: 2d6).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fixed various localization misses.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Compendium Updates</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Updated text for <strong>Book Of Grynn</strong> and <strong>Splintering Strike</strong> with errata
                    text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Improved Small Dagger</strong> is now correctly set as a secondary weapon.
                </li>

                    style="text-decoration:none; opacity:0.5; margin-left:5px;">#</a></h3>
            <h4>Features</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Massive Damage</strong>: Added the variant rule for massive damage to the system settings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Currency Inputs</strong>: Currency inputs are now delta inputs. You can for example write -4
                    or +4 and alter the value by that, rather than the final value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Currency Icons</strong>: The currency inputs can now optionally have a font-awesome icon
                    next to them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Spotlight Request Queue</strong>: Added a Spotlight Request Queue checkbox setting that
                    defaults to not being on. We've found that letting players request the spotlight and having it get
                    ordered from oldest to newest can often be a bad thing, as it is essentially recreating an
                    initiative order. You can still enable it if you do want this.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Bugfixes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where Countdown automated progression wasn't working when triggered by a player
                    due to permissions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    (Battlepoints) Calculation correction when multiples of one category were in the encounter. (IE, 3x
                    Standard --> 6 BP)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where the <code>/dr</code> command has working automation when used with a
                    character again.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fixed certain cases of hope/fear automation not setting the resources correctly on reroll. All in
                    all, if you had issues with hope/fear automation, it should be solved with this version.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Compendium Updates</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Guardian's Iron Will</strong>: Feature corrected to let you use an extra armor slot against
                    damage, rather than spending 1 stress.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Multiple Adversaries/Environments have been corrected to use direct damage for certain
                    features/attacks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Wings Of Light</strong>: Stress cost added.

                Please also remember to create a backup of your world before installing the update, just in case.

                <li>
                    Resolved several issues with the sheet layouts so they should look better even with longer

                <li>
                    Updated the Font styling to be more consistent, which makes it easier for custom modules to override

                    Resolved an issue that would cause data migrations from the old countdown system to the new one to

                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where the Countdown UI failed to position correctly if the sidebar was initially

                    on an inactive scene.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where editing homebrew Weapon/Armor features showed Downtime Moves as the title.
                    This now correctly shows Armor Feature/Weapon Feature.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where the Delete button on Subclass items in a Class wasn't working when the link

                <li>
                    The Compendium Browser is now checking on certain links it wasn't before. This makes broken links

                    The option to drag features between adversary sheets to quickly add a copy of an existing feature to

                <li>

            <h4>Forge</h4>
            <p>
                Following communication with Forge, conflicts that have persisted since launch appear to have been
                resolved. The system should now download and update normally. We appreciate confirmation from users
                testing this update.
            </p>
            <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Disabled v13 waypoints from being drawn while combat is active.</li>
                <li>Adversary basic attacks now display labels in the sidebar, including range and damage.</li>
                <li>Selecting experience increases during level-up no longer causes crashes.</li>
                <li>
                    Fixed an issue where spending and gaining Hope simultaneously could result in incorrect totals (-1
                    or
                    +1 instead of zero).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added new system settings in <strong>Appearance Settings</strong> to allow Features and other Items
                    to
                    be initially expanded or collapsed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Corrected effect calculations to properly use values from the Item model. This fixes issues such as
                    the Barrier item previously adding the character's Tier to armor instead of the Item's value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Critical damage calculations have been corrected. Previously, dice rolls were always maximized in
                    addition to adding the dice maximum, resulting in double-counted damage.
                </li>
                <li>Actor portraits are now top-focused, improving visual layout.</li>
                <li>
                    Removed redundant result text from reaction chat messages (e.g., “With Hope,” “With Fear”) to reduce
                    confusion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Corrected downtime refresh behavior to prevent erroneous refreshes of Session or Scene cooldowns.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Improved Character Creation layout: the top navigation bar has been removed, and Equipment is now
                    the
                    last tab, ensuring it is not overlooked while remaining optional.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where activating or deactivating beastforms could move characters to unintended
                    positions on the map.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved duplication of scrolling text messages (e.g., Hope +1, Stress -1) in certain situations.
                </li>
                <li>Companions can now level up independently and are no longer tied to the ranger's level-up.</li>
                <li>
                    Removed unintended icons in the Combat Tracker introduced in version 1.0.1, cleaning up the
                    interface.
                </li>
                <li>Domain cards now display their level in the loadout list.</li>
                <li>Custom Downtime Moves descriptions are now correctly shown in tooltips.</li>
                <li>Improved visibility and behavior of action buttons in chat messages.</li>
                <li>Resolved an issue where ancestries were missing in the SRD Sidebar.</li>
                <li>
                    Item Attachments have been temporarily removed until the backend work to fully support them is
                    complete.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where the movement style icon was not being displayed correctly in some cases.
