            <h2>Foundryborne Release Announcement</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Foundryborne</strong> team is proud to announce the release of version 1.4.0 (Festive
                Capybara) for the Foundryborne Daggerheart System.
            </p>
            <h3>Changelog</h3>
            <h4>Features</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Adversary Token Sizes</strong>: Added TokenSize for Adversaries. These are size categories
                    you can easily apply to adversaries to set them to predefined, uniform sizes (Tiny, Small, Medium,
                    Large etc). You can edit the token sizes attached to them in the Homebrew Settings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Adversary Features</strong>: Features for Adversaries/Environments now have an ActionForm
                    (Passive|Action|Reaction) that is displayed next to their name in the sheet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tooltips</strong>: Large visual improvements on tooltips.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sheet Improvements</strong>: Improved namefields in the sheets to wrap for longer names.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Chat Messages</strong>: Saving Throw entries in chat messages now display the token name
                    rather than the actor name.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Currency Transfer</strong>: You can now drag and drop currency from one character/party to
                    another to transfer the same way you do for quantities of items.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Bugfixes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Players rolling reaction rolls from chat messages wouldn't register correctly. Fixed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rolling reaction rolls from chat messages could fail to work with DiceSoNice active. Fixed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using an experience and simultaniously receiving automated hope on rolling didn't work correctly.
                    Fixed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fixed a bug during levelup where you couldn't select an increase on an experience you gained during
                    the levelup process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When taking Downtime, subclass features a character didn't have access to would show up as about to
                    be refreshed. Fixed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Extra-Damage effect from the BattlePoints section in the CombatTracker was being applied to
                    Characters added to combat. Fixed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fixed an error that could cause TagTeamRolls not to be created properly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fixed RangeDependant effect automation (such as the Paried item feature) to be based on player
                    targeting something in range.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drag-selecting in inputs - such as resource inputs - on the character sheet lead to unexpected
                    behavior. Fixed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fixed chat styles breaking in stream mode.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sheet Experience section would get wack when an experience name was really long. Fixed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Compendium Updates</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    All adversaries have had TokenSizes added.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All beastforms have had TokenSizes added.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All adversaries have had the hardcoded instances of their names removed from features and actions,
                    replaced with a dynamic @lookup. This means if you change the name of the adversary, or drag the
                    feature to another adversary, the name in the text will be updated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Removed adversary action descriptions that just copied the feature description. This means there's
                    only one place to edit instead of two when changing it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Wings Of Light</strong>: Corrected to be self-applied.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Conjure Swarm</strong>: Now correctly lowers incoming damage severity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Elundrian Chain Armor</strong>: Name corrected.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As a note - since Features now have an attached ActionForm (Passive, Action, Reaction) but they didn't
                previously - existing adversaries outside of the updated SRD Compendium will have defaulted to show
                Passive.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Effects Display</strong>: Added an Effects Display. The effects on a character will now be
                    shown in the top right next to the sidebar for easy removal of effects via right-clicking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Battlepoints Display</strong>: Added a Battlepoints Display for the GM in the combat tab,
                    giving an overview of the balance of an encounter, as well as the ability to apply encounter wide
                    effects such as extra damage for 2 BP. Homebrew effect support coming later.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Inventory Improvements</strong>: Added drag/drop reordering of items in the Character and

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Drag/Drop</strong>: Adjusted drag/drop of features between sheets to work without being in

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Biography</strong>: Improved the character sheet biography tab for better editing and a more
                    natural scroll experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Module Support</strong>: Added CSS variables to the :root scope for use by modules.

                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where the weapon attack tooltip in sheets was displaying incorrect damage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where transforming back from a Beastform would fail if the character's token
                    dimensions were smaller than 1.
                </li>
                <li>

            <h4>Features</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Currency Settings</strong>: All currency denominations can now be disabled in the homebrew
                    section if no coin tracking at all is desired.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Bugfixes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where the Downtime dialog would fail to open.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where TagTeamDialog crit damage was not correctly calculated when a multi-dice
                    formula was present (ex: 2d6).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fixed various localization misses.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Compendium Updates</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Updated text for <strong>Book Of Grynn</strong> and <strong>Splintering Strike</strong> with errata
                    text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Improved Small Dagger</strong> is now correctly set as a secondary weapon.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="v1.3.2">Version 1.3.2 <a href="#v1.3.2" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"
                    style="text-decoration:none; opacity:0.5; margin-left:5px;">#</a></h3>
            <h4>Features</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Massive Damage</strong>: Added the variant rule for massive damage to the system settings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Currency Inputs</strong>: Currency inputs are now delta inputs. You can for example write -4
                    or +4 and alter the value by that, rather than the final value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Currency Icons</strong>: The currency inputs can now optionally have a font-awesome icon
                    next to them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Spotlight Request Queue</strong>: Added a Spotlight Request Queue checkbox setting that
                    defaults to not being on. We've found that letting players request the spotlight and having it get
                    ordered from oldest to newest can often be a bad thing, as it is essentially recreating an
                    initiative order. You can still enable it if you do want this.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Bugfixes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where Countdown automated progression wasn't working when triggered by a player
                    due to permissions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    (Battlepoints) Calculation correction when multiples of one category were in the encounter. (IE, 3x
                    Standard --> 6 BP)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where the <code>/dr</code> command has working automation when used with a
                    character again.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fixed certain cases of hope/fear automation not setting the resources correctly on reroll. All in
                    all, if you had issues with hope/fear automation, it should be solved with this version.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Compendium Updates</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Guardian's Iron Will</strong>: Feature corrected to let you use an extra armor slot against
                    damage, rather than spending 1 stress.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Multiple Adversaries/Environments have been corrected to use direct damage for certain
                    features/attacks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Wings Of Light</strong>: Stress cost added.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Please also remember to create a backup of your world before installing the update, just in case.

                </li>

                    or beastform.
                </li>

                Following communication with Forge, conflicts that have persisted since launch appear to have been
                resolved. The system should now download and update normally. We appreciate confirmation from users
                testing this update.

            <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Disabled v13 waypoints from being drawn while combat is active.</li>
                <li>Adversary basic attacks now display labels in the sidebar, including range and damage.</li>
                <li>Selecting experience increases during level-up no longer causes crashes.</li>
                <li>
                    Fixed an issue where spending and gaining Hope simultaneously could result in incorrect totals (-1
                    or
                    +1 instead of zero).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added new system settings in <strong>Appearance Settings</strong> to allow Features and other Items
                    to
                    be initially expanded or collapsed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Corrected effect calculations to properly use values from the Item model. This fixes issues such as
                    the Barrier item previously adding the character's Tier to armor instead of the Item's value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Critical damage calculations have been corrected. Previously, dice rolls were always maximized in
                    addition to adding the dice maximum, resulting in double-counted damage.
                </li>
                <li>Actor portraits are now top-focused, improving visual layout.</li>
                <li>
                    Removed redundant result text from reaction chat messages (e.g., “With Hope,” “With Fear”) to reduce
                    confusion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Corrected downtime refresh behavior to prevent erroneous refreshes of Session or Scene cooldowns.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Improved Character Creation layout: the top navigation bar has been removed, and Equipment is now
                    the
                    last tab, ensuring it is not overlooked while remaining optional.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where activating or deactivating beastforms could move characters to unintended
                    positions on the map.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved duplication of scrolling text messages (e.g., Hope +1, Stress -1) in certain situations.
                </li>
                <li>Companions can now level up independently and are no longer tied to the ranger's level-up.</li>
                <li>
                    Removed unintended icons in the Combat Tracker introduced in version 1.0.1, cleaning up the
                    interface.
                </li>
                <li>Domain cards now display their level in the loadout list.</li>
                <li>Custom Downtime Moves descriptions are now correctly shown in tooltips.</li>
                <li>Improved visibility and behavior of action buttons in chat messages.</li>
                <li>Resolved an issue where ancestries were missing in the SRD Sidebar.</li>
                <li>
                    Item Attachments have been temporarily removed until the backend work to fully support them is
                    complete.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolved an issue where the movement style icon was not being displayed correctly in some cases.
                </li>
