          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <div class="faq">

            <details><summary><strong>Why is it called Foundryborne?</strong></summary><p>Communities in Daggerheart are all named -borne (Wildborne, Seabornde, Loreborne... etc.). Since this is a Community Project, we decided to name it Foundryborne.</p></details>

            <details><summary><strong>(How) Can I contribute?</strong></summary><p>You can find a link to the repository in the menu on this website. Please fork the repo &amp; create a pull request. We also recommend to join the Discord server.<br /><br />Check the <a href="https://github.com/Foundryborne/daggerheart/milestone/1">Milestones</a> and grab an unassigned task.</p></details>

            <details><summary><strong>What about translations?</strong></summary><p>We want to offer translations for the system as well, but that will probably happen after the initial release. For the officially announced translations we want to wait for their release first.</p></details>

            <details><summary><strong>Which FoundryVTT version will I need for this system?</strong></summary><p>We are developing for v13. If you don't want to upgrade yet for any reason, you can use the portable version of v13 temporarily until you are ready.</p></details>

            <details><summary><strong>What features/automations will there be?</strong></summary><p>We strife to automate as much as possible - where it makes sense. It will also be possible to disable automations in the system settings. You will also find a lot of settings for supporting homebrew content. We aim to include the complete SRD content as well.<br /><br />There will be character creation automation, as well as levelling up automation. We have a global fear tracker that can be customized, a robust countdown system, and even support for the optional action tracker, where players can request the spotlight from the GM and have 3 action tokens each.<br />This list is not complete.</p></details>

            <details><summary><strong>What about the Void playtest content?</strong></summary><p>The Void playtest materials are not part of the SRD and therefore can't be included with the system. However, the system makes it easily possible to add custom domains and (sub)classes.</p></details>

            <details><summary><strong>Will you include the official artwork?</strong></summary><p>The official artwork is not part of the SRD and therefore can't be included with the system. However, you will be able to provide your own artwork for everything. We aim to include as much (non-official) artwork as possible.</p></details>

            <details><summary><strong>What about Demiplane intergration?</strong></summary><p>Demiplane currently has no API to make any integration possible. However, we have reached out to them and will be actively talking with the Demiplane to see if any kind of integration would be possible - or makes sense. This is most likely a feature for a later release however, or possibly even a separate module.</p></details>

            <details><summary><strong>I have another Question!</strong></summary><p>Please join the Discord Server, especially the <code>#community-support</code> channel. If your question has not been answered, please use the ticket system in <code>#contact-us</code>.<br/>Please do not DM the dev team directly, as we are getting too many messages which are distracting us from our work.</p></details>
