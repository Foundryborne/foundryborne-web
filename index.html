                <strong>Light mode support</strong>: In the previous versions there were a few issues with people using

              </li>
              <li>

            <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Updated all SRD entries to make sure they reflect the latest errata.</li>
              <li>Several Bugfixes &amp; fixed typos, including wrong dice or damage type.</li>
              <li>Fixed the display of chat messages that are not supposed to be displayed, as they are redundant.</li>
              <li>Resolved several issues where effects were not or incorrectly applied.</li>
              <li>Updated the default view of the Loadout and Vault views to List View.</li>
              <li>Resolved several issues with the character creation process, and updated the order in which the
                characters are created to reflect the core rules.</li>
              <li>Resolved several issues with the sheet layouts so they should look better even with longer
                names/descriptions, which also helps the community translations.</li>
              <li>Resolved an issue where consumable items were not actually consumed on use.</li>
              <li>Resolved an issue where observer permissions would allow a player to use or edit items on other
                players sheets.</li>
              <li>Resolved an issue with scrolling battle text to better handle situations where multiple changes happen
                at the same time.</li>
              <li>Updated the Font styling to be more consistent, which makes it easier for custom modules to override
                the fonts.</li>
              <li>Resolved an issue where the hope cost for experiences would not be correctly automated in the dice
                roll dialog.</li>
              <li>Resolved an issue where the description for your experiences tooltip would not be displayed in the

            </ul>
            <h3>Version 1.2.1</h3>
            <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Resolved an issue that would cause data migrations from the old countdown system to the new one to
                fail in some cases. This should work without needing to go to a backup.
              <li>Resolved an issue where the Countdown UI failed to position correctly if the sidebar was initially
                expanded.</li>
              <li>Resolved an issue where the Countdown UI wasn't considering Foundry's UI-Scale setting and could
                become badly positioned.</li>
              <li>Resolved an issue where the Countdown UI would disappear if a user hit Escape.</li>
              <li>Resolved an issue where the 'clowncar' feature of the Party token didn't work properly if you used it
                on an inactive scene.</li>
              <li>Added a system setting under Appearance to hide the Countdown UI.</li>
              <li>Resolved an issue where editing homebrew Weapon/Armor features showed Downtime Moves as the title.
                This now correctly shows Armor Feature/Weapon Feature.</li>
              <li>Resolved an issue where the Delete button on Subclass items in a Class wasn't working when the link
                was broken.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Content Modules</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>The Compendium Browser is now checking on certain links it wasn't before. This makes broken links
                cause it to error out.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Please also remember to create a backup of your world before installing the update, just in case.</p>

            <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Disabled v13 waypoints from being drawn while combat is active.</li>
              <li>Adversary basic attacks now display labels in the sidebar, including range and damage.</li>
              <li>Selecting experience increases during level-up no longer causes crashes.</li>
              <li>Fixed an issue where spending and gaining Hope simultaneously could result in incorrect totals (-1 or
                +1 instead of zero).</li>
              <li>Added new system settings in <strong>Appearance Settings</strong> to allow Features and other Items to
                be initially expanded or collapsed.</li>
              <li>Corrected effect calculations to properly use values from the Item model. This fixes issues such as
                the Barrier item previously adding the character's Tier to armor instead of the Item's value.</li>
              <li>Critical damage calculations have been corrected. Previously, dice rolls were always maximized in
                addition to adding the dice maximum, resulting in double-counted damage.</li>
              <li>Actor portraits are now top-focused, improving visual layout.</li>
              <li>Removed redundant result text from reaction chat messages (e.g., “With Hope,” “With Fear”) to reduce
                confusion.</li>
              <li>Corrected downtime refresh behavior to prevent erroneous refreshes of Session or Scene cooldowns.</li>
              <li>Improved Character Creation layout: the top navigation bar has been removed, and Equipment is now the
                last tab, ensuring it is not overlooked while remaining optional.</li>
              <li>Resolved an issue where activating or deactivating beastforms could move characters to unintended
                positions on the map.</li>
              <li>Resolved duplication of scrolling text messages (e.g., Hope +1, Stress -1) in certain situations.</li>
              <li>Companions can now level up independently and are no longer tied to the ranger's level-up.</li>
              <li>Removed unintended icons in the Combat Tracker introduced in version 1.0.1, cleaning up the interface.
              </li>
              <li>Domain cards now display their level in the loadout list.</li>
              <li>Custom Downtime Moves descriptions are now correctly shown in tooltips.</li>
              <li>Improved visibility and behavior of action buttons in chat messages.</li>
              <li>Resolved an issue where ancestries were missing in the SRD Sidebar.</li>
              <li>Item Attachments have been temporarily removed until the backend work to fully support them is
                complete.</li>
              <li>Resolved an issue where the movement style icon was not being displayed correctly in some cases.</li>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class="faq">
          <details>
            <summary><strong>Why is it called Foundryborne?</strong></summary>
            <p>Communities in Daggerheart are all named -borne (Wildborne, Seabornde, Loreborne... etc.). Since this is
              a Community Project, we decided to name it Foundryborne.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary><strong>(How) Can I contribute?</strong></summary>
            <p>You can find a link to the repository in the menu on this website. Please fork the repo &amp; create a
              pull request. We also recommend to join the Discord server.<br /><br />Check the <a
                href="https://github.com/Foundryborne/daggerheart/milestone/1">Milestones</a> and grab an unassigned
              task.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary><strong>What about translations?</strong></summary>
            <p>Currently, community translations should be added as a module (there are already a few available!). For
              the officially announced translations we want to wait for their release first.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary><strong>Which FoundryVTT version will I need for this system?</strong></summary>
            <p>We are developing for v13. If you don't want to upgrade yet for any reason, you can use the portable
              version of v13 temporarily until you are ready.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary><strong>What features/automations will there be?</strong></summary>
            <p>We strife to automate as much as possible - where it makes sense. It will also be possible to disable
              automations in the system settings. You will also find a lot of settings for supporting homebrew content.
              We aim to include the complete SRD content as well.<br /><br />There will be character creation
              automation, as well as levelling up automation. We have a global fear tracker that can be customized, a
              robust countdown system, and even support for the optional action tracker, where players can request the
              spotlight from the GM and have 3 action tokens each.<br />This list is not complete.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary><strong>What about the Void playtest content?</strong></summary>
            <p>The Void playtest materials are not part of the SRD and therefore can't be included with the system.
              However, the system makes it easily possible to add custom domains and (sub)classes.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary><strong>Will you include the official artwork?</strong></summary>
            <p>The official artwork is not part of the SRD and therefore can't be included with the system. However, you
              will be able to provide your own artwork for everything. We aim to include as much (non-official) artwork

            <summary><strong>What about Demiplane integration?</strong></summary>
            <p>Demiplane currently has no API to make any integration possible. However, we have reached out to them and
              will be actively talking with the Demiplane to see if any kind of integration would be possible - or makes
              sense. This is most likely a feature for a later release however, or possibly even a separate module.</p>
