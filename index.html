              <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Disabled v13 waypoints from being drawn while combat is active.</li>
                <li>Adversary basic attacks now display labels in the sidebar, including range and damage.</li>
                <li>Selecting experience increases during level-up no longer causes crashes.</li>
                <li>Fixed an issue where spending and gaining Hope simultaneously could result in incorrect totals (-1 or +1 instead of zero).</li>
                <li>Added new system settings in <strong>Appearance Settings</strong> to allow Features and other Items to be initially expanded or collapsed.</li>
                <li>Corrected effect calculations to properly use values from the Item model. This fixes issues such as the Barrier item previously adding the character's Tier to armor instead of the Item's value.</li>
                <li>Critical damage calculations have been corrected. Previously, dice rolls were always maximized in addition to adding the dice maximum, resulting in double-counted damage.</li>
                <li>Actor portraits are now top-focused, improving visual layout.</li>
                <li>Removed redundant result text from reaction chat messages (e.g., “With Hope,” “With Fear”) to reduce confusion.</li>
                <li>Corrected downtime refresh behavior to prevent erroneous refreshes of Session or Scene cooldowns.</li>
                <li>Improved Character Creation layout: the top navigation bar has been removed, and Equipment is now the last tab, ensuring it is not overlooked while remaining optional.</li>
                <li>Resolved an issue where activating or deactivating beastforms could move characters to unintended positions on the map.</li>
                <li>Resolved duplication of scrolling text messages (e.g., Hope +1, Stress -1) in certain situations.</li>
                <li>Companions can now level up independently and are no longer tied to the ranger's level-up.</li>
                <li>Removed unintended icons in the Combat Tracker introduced in version 1.0.1, cleaning up the interface.</li>
                <li>Domain cards now display their level in the loadout list.</li>
                <li>Custom Downtime Moves descriptions are now correctly shown in tooltips.</li>
                <li>Improved visibility and behavior of action buttons in chat messages.</li>
                <li>Resolved an issue where ancestries were missing in the SRD Sidebar.</li>
                <li>Item Attachments have been temporarily removed until the backend work to fully support them is complete.</li>
                <li>Resolved an issue where the movement style icon was not being displayed correctly in some cases.</li>

              <summary><strong>What about translations?</strong></summary>
              <p>We want to offer translations for the system as well, but that will probably happen after the initial release. For the officially announced translations we want to wait for their release first.</p>

              <summary><strong>Which FoundryVTT version will I need for this system?</strong></summary>
              <p>We are developing for v13. If you don't want to upgrade yet for any reason, you can use the portable version of v13 temporarily until you are ready.</p>

              <summary><strong>What features/automations will there be?</strong></summary>
              <p>We strife to automate as much as possible - where it makes sense. It will also be possible to disable automations in the system settings. You will also find a lot of settings for supporting homebrew content. We aim to include the complete SRD content as well.<br /><br />There will be character creation automation, as well as levelling up automation. We have a global fear tracker that can be customized, a robust countdown system, and even support for the optional action tracker, where players can request the spotlight from the GM and have 3 action tokens each.<br />This list is not complete.</p>

              <summary><strong>What about the Void playtest content?</strong></summary>
              <p>The Void playtest materials are not part of the SRD and therefore can't be included with the system. However, the system makes it easily possible to add custom domains and (sub)classes.</p>

              <summary><strong>Will you include the official artwork?</strong></summary>
              <p>The official artwork is not part of the SRD and therefore can't be included with the system. However, you will be able to provide your own artwork for everything. We aim to include as much (non-official) artwork as possible.</p>

              <summary><strong>What about Demiplane intergration?</strong></summary>
              <p>Demiplane currently has no API to make any integration possible. However, we have reached out to them and will be actively talking with the Demiplane to see if any kind of integration would be possible - or makes sense. This is most likely a feature for a later release however, or possibly even a separate module.</p>
